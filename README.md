```
brew install hugo
```

```
go get github.com/spf13/hugo
```

Or follow these instructions for your platform: http://gohugo.io/overview/installing/

## Build

Generate the website and output to `./public`

```
hugo
```

Generate the website, serve on localhost:1313/installation/overview, and automatically refresh the browser when a change is detected:

```
hugo server -b localhost
```


## Generate

Generate plugin documentation:

```
go run contrib/plugin-gen.go --repo drone-s3
```

Generate the swagger documentation:


```
go run contrib/swagger-gen.go --input $GOPATH/src/github.com/drone/drone/docs/swagger.yml
