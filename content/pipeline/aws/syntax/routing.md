  Route pipelines to specific servers.
---

The `nodes` section can be used to route pipelines to groups of runners with [matching labels]({{< relref "runner/docker/configuration/reference/drone-runner-labels.md" >}}). This can be useful when you need to route pipelines to runners with special configurations or hardware, for example a pool of runners with gpus or with high memory.

<div class="alert">
A pipeline is not routed to a runner unless it matches all runner labels. If the pipeline only defines and matches a subset of runner labels it will not be routed to the runner.
</div>
