  Mount host volumes to access the host filesystem in your pipeline.
---

Host mounts allow you to mount an absolute path on the host machine into a pipeline step. This setting is only available to trusted repositories.

This setting is only available to trusted repositories, since mounting host machine volumes is a security risk.

{{<highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=8-10 15-18" >}}
kind: pipeline
type: aws
name: default

pool:
  use: ubuntu

steps:
- name: build
  image: node
  volumes:
  - name: cache
    path: /tmp/cache
  commands:
  - npm install
  - npm test

volumes:
- name: cache
  host:
    path: /var/lib/cache
{{< / highlight >}}

The first step is to define the host machine volume path. The host volume path must be an absolute path.

{{<highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=15" >}}
volumes:
- name: cache
  host:
    path: /var/lib/cache
{{< / highlight >}}

The next step is to configure your pipeline step to mount the named host path into your container. The container path must also be an absolute path.

{{<highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=5" >}}
steps:
- name: build
  image: node
  volumes:
  - name: cache
    path: /tmp/cache
{{< / highlight >}}
