  Install the runner using Docker for Windows
---

<div class="alert alert-error">
Support for Docker pipelines on Windows is experimental and is not recommended for production use at this time.
</div>

This article explains how to install the Docker runner on Windows. The Docker runner is packaged as a minimal Docker image distributed on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/drone/drone-runner-docker), and is available for the following kernel versions:

* 1809
* 1903

# Download

Install Docker and pull the public image:

```
$ docker pull drone/drone-runner-docker:1
```

# Configuration

The Docker runner is configured using environment variables. This article references the below configuration options. See [Configuration]({{< relref "../configuration/reference" >}}) for a complete list of configuration options.

* __DRONE_RPC_HOST__
  : provides the hostname (and optional port) of your Drone server. The runner connects to the server at the host address to receive pipelines for execution.

* __DRONE_RPC_PROTO__
  : provides the protocol used to connect to your Drone server. The value must be either http or https.

* __DRONE_RPC_SECRET__
  : provides the shared secret used to authenticate with your Drone server. This must match the secret defined in your Drone server configuration.

# Installation

The below command creates a container and starts the Docker runner. _Remember to replace the environment variables below with your Drone server details._

{{< highlight bash "linenos=table,hl_lines=3-7" >}}
docker run --detach \
  --volume=//./pipe/docker_engine://./pipe/docker_engine \
  --env=DRONE_RPC_PROTO=https \
  --env=DRONE_RPC_HOST=drone.company.com \
  --env=DRONE_RPC_SECRET=super-duper-secret \
  --env=DRONE_RUNNER_CAPACITY=2 \
  --env=DRONE_RUNNER_NAME=my-first-runner \
  --publish=3000:3000 \
  --restart=always \
  --name=runner \
  drone/drone-runner-docker:1
{{< / highlight >}}

# Verification

Use the `docker logs` command to view the logs and verify the runner successfully established a connection with the Drone server.

```
$ docker logs runner

INFO[0000] starting the server
INFO[0000] successfully pinged the remote server 
```
