Drone comes with built-in support for Bitbucket Server(stash) To enable Bitbucket Server you should configure the Bitbucket driver using the following environment variables:

```bash
REMOTE_DRIVER=bitbucketserver
REMOTE_CONFIG=https://{servername}?consumer_key={consumer_key}&git_username={git_username}&git_password={git_password}&consumer_rsa={path_private_key}&open={unused}
```

# Bitbucket Server configuration

The following is the standard URI connection scheme:

```
scheme://host[?options]
```

The components of this string are:

* `scheme` server protocol `http` or `https`.
* `host` server address to connect to.
* `?options` connection specific options.

# Bitbucket Server options

This section lists all connection options used in the connection string format. Connection options are pairs in the following form: `name=value`. The value is always case sensitive. Separate options with the ampersand (i.e. &) character:

* `consumer_key` oauth client id for registered application (must add in application links incoming auth in Bitbucket server).
* `git_username` Service account that can http clone the projects.
* `git_password` password for the service account that can http clone the projects.
* `consumer_rsa` Path to the private key for oauth1 (must mount the private key file into the container using volumes).
* `open=false` not currently used but will be added later

# Service Account

Unforunately Bitbucket server doesn't support oauth http cloning of repos. This means we need a service account that can clone repos for us. Please please go [here](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-2722) to vote for this feature and we can move to not need service accounts

# Private Key File

The oauth private key file needs to be mounted into your Drone container at runtime. You can mount the key into the container using the `--volume` command line parameter:

```
docker run --volume=/host/path/to/key.pem:/container/path/to/key.pem
```

The path to your oauth private key file should be included in your configuration string:

```
consumer_rsa=/container/path/to/key.pem
```

# Bitbucket Server registration

You must register your application with Bitbucket in order to allow for auth1. Navigate to admin choose application links and add a new application link

Please use `http://drone.mycompany.com/authorize` as the Authorization callback URL in the incoming auth(at the bottom):

* Add the url to drone on the application path
* You'll also need to add the public key (public key to the private key in consumer_rsa_key file)



# Remote Driver Feature Chart

Drone currently only supports BitBucket Cloud (hosted BitBucket).
Contributions for BitBucket Server are welcomed.

Also, we only support git on BitBucket Cloud. While we do have a Mercurial
Drone Plugin, the webhook output is slightly different for Hg projects. We'd
love to see pull requests for this as well.
