The workspace defines the shared volume and working directory shared by all pipeline steps. The default workspace matches the below pattern, based on your repository url.

```
/drone/src/github.com/octocat/hello-world
```

The workspace can be customized using the workspace block in the Yaml file:

```diff
+workspace:
+  base: /go/src
+  path: github.com/octocat/hello-world

pipeline:
  build:
    image: golang:latest
    commands:
      - go get
      - go test
```

The base attribute defines a shared base volume available to all pipeline steps. This ensures your source code, dependencies and compiled binaries are persisted and shared between steps.

```diff
workspace:
+ base: /go/src
  path: github.com/octocat/hello-world

pipeline:
  deps:
    image: golang:latest
    commands:
      - go get
      - go test
  build:
    image: node:latest
    commands:
      - go build
```

This would be equivalent to the following docker commands:

```
docker volume create my-named-volume

docker run --volume=my-named-volume:/go/src golang:latest
docker run --volume=my-named-volume:/go/src node:latest
```

The path attribute defines the working directory of your build. This is where your code is cloned and will be the default working directory of every step in your build process. The path must be relative and is combined with your base path.

```diff
workspace:
  base: /go/src
+ path: github.com/octocat/hello-world
```

```text
git clone https://github.com/octocat/hello-world \
  /go/src/github.com/octocat/hello-world
```
