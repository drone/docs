# Why does my build fail?

There is no easy way to answer this question. There are a number of reasons your build could pass locally and fail when running in Drone. Most people _incorrectly_ assume there must be a bug with Drone. The most common reasons for build failure are incorrect configuration and missing dependencies in Docker images.

We recommend using the Drone command line utility for local testing and debugging. If you are unable to resolve the issue locally you can use the community [support forums](https://gitter.im/drone/drone) to ask for help. If you engage the community for help please provide sample Yaml configurations and build output.

# How can I trigger builds?

Builds are automatically triggered by post-commit hooks from your version control system. You can use the API or command line tools to re-start or re-run existing builds with an auto-incremented build number.

# How can I trigger downstream builds?

Downstream or cascading builds can be configured using the [downstream plugin](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-downstream). This plugin lets you define downstream dependencies and trigger downstream builds from the Yaml file.

# How can I trigger upstream builds?

Upstream triggers are not currently supported and are not currently planned. This functionality can be achieved, however, by creating a custom script or cron task using the API or command line tools.

# How can I schedule builds?

There are no built-in scheduling capabilities. External scheduling tools such as cron can be used in conjunction with the official API or command line tools to execute nightly builds.

# How do I test Docker images?

You can use the Docker plugin to build and publish images. If you need to build and _test_ your image you can mount the Docker socket into your build environment to work directly with the host machines Docker daemon.

```
pipeline:
  build:
    image: docker
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    commands:
      - docker build ...
      - docker run ...
      - docker push ...
```

# How do I use Docker compose?

The `services` section of the `.drone.yml` is the official approach for composing service containers. You can alternatively mount the Docker socket into your build environment to work directly with the host machines Docker daemon and Docker compose.

```
pipeline:
  build:
    image: ...
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    commands:
      - docker-compose up
      - ...
```

# How do I increase my build timeout?

The default timeout is 60 minutes and can be increased in your repository settings screen. Please note that only a system administrator can increase the build timeout duration for security reasons.

# How can I get colored output?

Drone supports basic ansi terminal characters and colored output. It is important to note colored output is controlled by the program generating the output. It is common for programs to disable colored output when the terminal is non-interactive (closed stdin). Drone runs a non-interactive terminal to prevent things like command line prompts from hanging the build.

# Cannot connect to a database.

The most common issue is that databases take time to start and accept connections. We recommend adding `sleep` to your build script to give the database enough time to start. You should also make sure you are connecting to your database using `localhost`.

# Cannot create a database.

Most official docker images use environment variables to create databases and users at runtime. See the below example for reference. Please also check the official image documentation for more details.

```
services:
  database:
    image: mysql:5.6.27
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=test
      - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes  
```

# Cannot provide a database user or password.

 Most official docker images use environment variables to create the default user and password. This includes the ability to authenticate with no password. See the below example for reference. Please also check the official image documentation for more details.

```
 services:
   database:
     image: mysql:5.6.27
     environment:
       - MYSQL_DATABASE=test
       - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
       - MYSQL_USER=foo
       - MYSQL_PASSWORD=bar  
 ```
