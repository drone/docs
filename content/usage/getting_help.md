If you are experiencing issues please be sure to read the documentation and search for existing issues and error messages using site search. We monitor [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drone.io) for questions and answers.

You can also post questions or comments to our [community forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/droneci). This is a great place to interact directly with the project maintainers and community members.  Posts prior to July 1, 2018 can be found at [discourse](https://discourse.drone.io/).

# Reporting Issues

We unfortunately receive a large number of false positive issues. We ask that you discuss potential problems in our [community forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/droneci) before creating github issues.

# IRC channel 

A community exists in an unofficial IRC channel on Freenode at [#drone-ci](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=drone-ci).

While the community is happy to discuss any topic related to Drone, remember to create a topic in [/r/droneci](https://www.reddit.com/r/droneci) if you need support. This has the advantage to benefit to everyone and not answer the same questions over and over again.
