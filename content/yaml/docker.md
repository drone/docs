This document introduces the data structures that represent the _docker pipeline_. The Docker pipeline is a continuous integration pipeline that executes pipeline steps inside isolated Docker containers. 

# The `Resource` interface

The [`Resource`](#the-resource-interface) interface is implemented by all top-level objects, including the docker [`Pipeline`](#the-pipeline-object).

{{< highlight typescript "linenos=table" >}}
interface Resource {
  kind: string;
  type: string;
  name: string;
  concurrency: Concurrency;
  depends_on: string[];
}
{{< / highlight >}}

## The `kind` attribute

Defines the kind of resource, used to identify the resource implementation. This attribute is of type `string` and is required.

## The `type` attribute

Defines the type of resource, used to identify the resource implementation. This attribute is of type `string` and is required.

## The `name` attribute

The name of the resource. This value is required and must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. This value is displayed in the user interface (non-normative) and is used to identify the pipeline (non-normative).

## The `concurrency` attribute

Defines the concurrency limits for the pipeline stage. This attribute is of type [`Concurrency`](#the-concurrency-object) and is optional.

## The `depends_on` attribute

Defines a list of pipeline dependencies, used to defer execution of the pipeline until the named pipelines are in a completed state. This attribute is an array of type `string` and is optional.

# The `Pipeline` object

The [`Pipeline`](#the-pipeline-object) is the top-level object used to represent the docker pipeline. The [`Pipeline`](#the-pipeline-object) object implements the [`Resource`](#the-resource-interface) interface.

{{< highlight typescript "linenos=table" >}}
class Pipeline : Resource {
  kind:      string;
  type:      string;
  name:      string;

{{< / highlight >}}

## The `kind` attribute

The kind of resource. This value must be set to `pipeline`.

## The `type` attribute

The type of resource. This value must be set to `docker`.
