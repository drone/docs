Drone can automate publishing files at the end of each successful build. Drone includes a
number of publish plugins that can be configured in the `publish` section of the `.drone.yml` file.

Publishes are **skipped** for:

* Failed builds

Publish a Docker image to a specified repo or registry. Supports the following configurations:

 * Private Docker Registry (unauthenticated)

 * Private Docker Registry (authenticated)
   e.g. login with `username` + push to `docker.example.com/image:tag`
 * Push to Docker Hub user ID 
   e.g. `username/image:tag`
 * Push to Docker Hub company or group 
   e.g. login with `username` but push to `company/image:tag`

.. code-block:: console

    publish:
        docker:
            dockerfile: MyDockerFile
            docker_host: tcp://docker.example.com:2375
            docker_version: 1.3.0
            registry_host: docker.example.com
            registry_protocol: https
            registry_login: true
            registry_login_uri: /registry/v1/
            username: myuser
            password: mypassword
            email: myuser@example.com

dockerfile
  The Dockerfile you want to use to build your final image.
  **Default:** `./Dockerfile` in the root of your codebase.

docker_host

  It has the same format than `-H` flag of docker binary.
  **Note:** This does not need to match the final destination/end-point for your image.

docker_version
  The version of Docker Engine that is running on the remote Docker server (not the registry).

registry_login_url (optional)
  The full login URI used to post authentication details (e.g. `https://docker.company.com/v1/`)

registry_login (optional)
  Does your custom registry endpoint require login? Defaults to `false`
  **Note:** This is not applicable when pushing to Docker Hub, it will always require authentication.

image_name
  The name you would like to give your image (excluding the image tag)

tag (optional)
  A custom tag for this image. 

tags (optional)
  The tag(s) you would like to set for this image build. Will be combined with the "tag" field if both are specified. If no tags are specified in either field, the image will be tagged with the short git commit ID `git rev-parse --short HEAD`

username (optional for private repositories)
  The username used to authenticate to the private registry or to Docker Hub

password (optional for private repositories)
  Your authentication password

email (optional for private repositories)
  Your email address

keep_build (optional)
  Set to `true` if you would like to leave the final image on the `docker_server` used to build it. Default is `false`, which cleans up the build after successfully pushing to the registry.
